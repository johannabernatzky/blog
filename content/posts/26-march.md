Where am I? Everything is bright, I have forgotten my past, I don’t know my future. All I have is now, an existence barely there. I am flickering in and out of consciousness. I feel something. A rhythm is driving me forwards. In and out and in and out. What am I running towards? My path leaves a squiggly line in the whiteness.

Gone. Loneliness is a freeing thing. It has given me wings to soar, faster than I ever did before. What does it matter if I have no goal? I make my own pace, I light up your screen. | 消失。孤独实际是无拘无束的，赋予我飞翔的翅膀，让我飞得更快。即使我毫无目标，又如何呢？我有适合自己的步伐，我点亮了你的屏幕。
Where am I going? I’ve left you a present, a painting almost. What does it look like to you? A sunset? Maybe a face? So many things look like faces if you try hard enough. | 我在去往何方？我已经给予你一份礼物，几乎是一副画作。你觉得它像什么？夕照？或许一张脸？如果你仔细看看，会发现许多像人脸的地方。
I worry my story will have no end as it has no beginning. Remember me today. | 我担心我的故事没有结局，正如它没有开始一样。请记住今天的我。
